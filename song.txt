Time has worn the soldiers down
Marched for many miles
In the eastern lands so cursed
Time to make a stand

Tsar has scorched his nation’s land
Nothing to be found
Hunger grasp the soliders heart
20 000 men strong

Listen, excuse for a king
Trust me, this fight you can’t win

Poltava
Rode to certain death and pain
Poltava
Swedish soldiers met their bane
Poltava
Sacrificed their lives in vain
Poltava
